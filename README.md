# TIA_Portal_Template
template project structure for TIA Portal Projects managed via github

## Directory Structure:
  * .git - created by github's process
  * archives - put tia portal archives here
  * plc_src - latest work copy of project should go here. avoid multiple projects in this directory and use archives to manage versions.
  * src - source files. e.g. xml or .scl files for plc project source files, python scripts for automation, and/or C# scripts for openess integration
